electrical devices (clients) have different power requirements - voltage, socket, plug-type
we cannot modify our client(devices) to support every possible interface

so adapter is attached to device to accept new ports, voltage etc externally. Adapter gives us interface (Y) which we require from the interface we have (X). 
it adapts interface X to interface Y req.
