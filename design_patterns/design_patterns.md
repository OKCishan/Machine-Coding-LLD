# Design Patterns README

Welcome to the Design Patterns README, where we explore various design patterns categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns. These patterns are fundamental concepts in software engineering that help solve common design problems in elegant and efficient ways.

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton

**Description**: Singleton ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Frequently asked about in interviews.

### Factory Method

**Description**: Factory Method defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. A versatile creational pattern.

### Abstract Factory

**Description**: Abstract Factory makes groups of related items. It's essential for creating families of objects while ensuring they work seamlessly together.

### Builder

**Description**: Builder separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. This pattern is commonly asked about in interviews.

### Prototype

**Description**: Prototype creates copies of fully prepared examples, offering a way to efficiently produce new objects.

### Object Pool
![Image](images/object-pool.png)

**Description**: Object Pooling is used to manage a pool of reusable objects efficiently. It's essential for resource-intensive applications.

### Lazy Initialization

**Description**: Lazy Initialization delays the creation of an object until it's first needed, optimizing resource usage.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter

**Description**: Adapter connects things with different interfaces. It's useful when integrating existing code with new systems.

### Bridge
![Image](images/bridge.png)

**Description**: Bridge links how an object works to what it does. It promotes decoupling between abstractions and implementations.

### Composite
![Image](images/composite.png)

**Description**: Composite forms tree-like structures of simple and complex parts. It's valuable for representing hierarchies of objects.

### Decorator
![Image](images/decorator.png)

**Description**: Decorator adds features to objects without changing their core. It's an elegant way to extend object behavior dynamically.

### Facade
![Image](images/facade.png)

**Description**: Facade represents a whole system with a single, simplified interface. It simplifies complex subsystems.

### Flyweight

**Description**: Flyweight shares small, reusable items efficiently, saving memory and resources.

### Proxy
![Image](images/proxy.png)

**Description**: Proxy represents another object, controlling access or actions. It's used for various purposes, including lazy loading.

## Behavioral Patterns

### Command
![Image](images/command.png)

**Description**: Command turns a request into an object, making it ready for action. Useful for implementing undo/redo functionality.

### Iterator
![Image](images/iterator.png)

**Description**: Iterator accesses elements in a collection one by one, simplifying traversal of various data structures.

### Mediator
![Image](images/mediator.png)

**Description**: Mediator simplifies interactions between different classes by centralizing communication logic.

### Memento
![Image](images/memento.png)

**Description**: Memento captures and restores an object's state. It's beneficial for implementing undo mechanisms.

### Observer
![Image](images/observer.png)

**Description**: Observer notifies classes about changes in other objects. It's crucial for implementing the publish-subscribe model.

### Visitor

**Description**: Visitor adds new operations to a class without altering it, promoting flexibility and extensibility.
